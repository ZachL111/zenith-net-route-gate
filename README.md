# zenith-net-route-gate

`zenith-net-route-gate` explores networking in TypeScript. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Zenith Net Route Gate Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Feature Notes

- Includes extended examples for retry behavior, including `recovery` and `degraded`.
- Documents policy decisions tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Why This Exists

This is not a wrapper around a service. It is a self-contained project that shows how the model behaves when demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight move in different directions.

## Code Tour

- `src`: primary implementation
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands
- `package.json`: Node package scripts

## Implementation Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps packet shape, socket state, and retry behavior in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 171, with risk penalty 6, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 3. The TypeScript project keeps types close to the model and compiles before running its checks.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Boundaries

The examples cover useful edges, not every edge. A larger version would add malformed-input tests, richer reports, and deeper domain parsers.

## Roadmap

- Add a loader for `examples/extended_cases.csv` and promote selected cases into the language test suite.
- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Add one more networking fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with TypeScript available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
